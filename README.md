##  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Built a data model and cleaned raw data for consistency and usability.
- Delivered a structured dataset ready for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Formulated and answered key analysis questions.
- Generated statistical summaries and visual insights using SQL and Python.

### 3. Forecasting

- Developed predictive models to estimate:
  
  - Daily train rides for the next month.
  - Forecasted revenue on each day.
  - Demand across ticket classes.
    
- Visualized results with clear and interpretable plots.

### 4. Visualization & Reporting

- Built a Tableau dashboard consolidating all insights.
- Delivered a comprehensive report and presentation summarizing methods, findings, and business implications.
